      <b>Corn pudding</b> doesn't get the same attention as some other holiday side <br/>
      dishes, but it's a real crowd-pleaser that <em>pairs perfectly with all your
        favorite</em> <br/> special-occasion meats.
    </p>

    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        2 pounds frozen yellow corn, thawed and drained
      </li>
      <li>
        3 tablespoons maple syrup
      </li>
      <li>
        6 large eggs
      </li>
      <li>
        1/2 cup of milk
      </li>
      <li>
        3 teaspons kosher salt (cut in half if using fine salt)
      </li>
      <li>
        1/4 cup all-purpose flour
      </li>
      <li>
        1 teaspoon baking powder
      </li>
      <li>
        1 1/2 cups heavy cream
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup melted butter, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How to make them:</h1>

    <p>
      <b>Step 1</b><br/>
      Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking 
      sheet with a silicone pad.<br/> Place an 8x11-inch baking dish on the pad.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <b>Step 2</b><br/>
      Place corn in a blender or food processor. Add maple syrup, eggs, milk, 
      kosher salt, cayenne pepper, flour, and baking powder.<br/> Mix briefly with a 
      spatula to push down the dry ingredients.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <b>Step 3</b><br/>
      Pulse mixture until it begins to come together. Then increase setting to 
      high and blend until completely smooth, 2 or 3 minutes.<br/> Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl. 
      Add heavy cream and 2/3 of the melted butter. Whisk to thoroughly blend.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <b>Step 4</b><br/>
      Grease the baking dish with the rest of the butter. Pour batter into the
      baking dish.<br/> Bake in the preheated oven on the baking sheet until the pudding
      browned and set, between 60 and 75 minutes depending on the size and shape of your baking dish.
