      <b>Corn pudding</b> doesn't get the same attention as some other holiday
      side <br />
      dishes, but it's a real crowd-pleaser that
      <em>pairs perfectly with all your favorite</em> <br />
      special-occasion meats.
    </p>

    <h1 class="ing-header">Ingredients:</h1>

    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>2 pounds frozen yellow corn, thawed and drained</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
      <li>6 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
      <li>3 teaspons kosher salt (cut in half if using fine salt)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup melted butter, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="instr-header">How to make them:</h1>

    <p class="instructions">
      <b class="step">Step 1</b><br />
      Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking
      sheet with a silicone pad.<br />
      Place an 8x11-inch baking dish on the pad.
      <br />
      <br />

      <b class="step">Step 2</b><br />
      Place corn in a blender or food processor. Add maple syrup, eggs, milk,
      kosher salt, cayenne pepper, flour, and baking powder.<br />
      Mix briefly with a spatula to push down the dry ingredients.
      <br />
      <br />

      <b class="step">Step 3</b><br />
      Pulse mixture until it begins to come together. Then increase setting to
      high and blend until completely smooth, 2 or 3 minutes.<br />
      Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl. Add heavy cream and 2/3 of the melted
      butter. Whisk to thoroughly blend.
      <br />
      <br />

      <b class="step">Step 4</b><br />
      Grease the baking dish with the rest of the butter. Pour batter into the
      baking dish.<br />
      Bake in the preheated oven on the baking sheet until the pudding browned
      and set, between 60 and 75 minutes depending on the size and shape of your
      baking dish.
