    <h1>How to make them:</h1>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    Gather the ingredients. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
    <br>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    To prepare the sweet potatoes: Put sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and
    cover with water. Cook over medium-high heat until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
    Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
    <br>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    Mash drained sweet potatoes with a fork.<br>
    Add eggs; mix until well combined. Add sugar, milk, butter, vanilla, and salt; mix until smooth.<br>
    Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish.
    <br>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    To make the topping: Mix brown sugar and flour together in a medium bowl<br>
    Cut in butter with a pastry cutter until mixture is coarse and looks like peas; don't overmix.<br>
    Stir in pecans. Sprinkle topping over sweet potato mixture.
    <br>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
    <br>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    Serve and enjoy!
